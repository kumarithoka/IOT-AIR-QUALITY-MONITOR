Project Description:
IoT Air Quality Monitor Description
The IoT Air Quality Monitor is a smart environmental monitoring device designed to measure key air quality parameters such as PM2.5 particles and CO2 levels in real-time. Using IoT technology, it collects data continuously and uploads it to a cloud-based dashboard for easy access and analysis.

Key Features:
Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring:
Equipped with sensors that detect fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, the device provides continuous updates on air quality.

Wireless Data Transmission:
The system uses a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller (like ESP32) to send the collected data securely to an online cloud platform.

Cloud Dashboard Visualization:
Air quality metrics are displayed live on a user-friendly cloud dashboard, which also stores historical data to analyze trends over time.

Alerts & Insights:
The system can be configured to notify users if pollutant levels exceed safe thresholds, helping to maintain a healthier environment.

Benefits:
Promotes awareness of indoor and outdoor air quality.

Helps users take timely actions to improve air conditions.

Enables remote monitoring from anywhere using internet-connected devices.

Supports data-driven decision making for health and safety.

Applications:
Home and office air quality monitoring

Schools, hospitals, and public buildings

Industrial environments for pollution control

Smart city environmental monitoring initiatives

This system offers an accessible, affordable, and scalable solution to monitor and improve air quality, leveraging IoT technology and cloud computing for enhanced environmental safety.
